- **DID Check**: `python tests/check_did.py` (if tests directory exists)

## Architecture Overview

This is an **Enhanced Automated Multi-Account Trading System** for Webull with the following key components:

### Core System Structure
```
main.py - Main entry point and system orchestrator
â”œâ”€â”€ auth/ - Authentication and credential management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ credentials.py - Encrypted credential storage in data/ folder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ login_manager.py - Handles Webull login with retry logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ session_manager.py - Session persistence and restoration
â”œâ”€â”€ accounts/ - Account discovery and management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ account_manager.py - Multi-account handling and configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ webull/ - Webull API wrapper and endpoints
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ webull.py - Main API client
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ endpoints.py - API endpoint definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ config/ - Configuration management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.py - PersonalTradingConfig (single source of truth)
â”œâ”€â”€ database/ - Data persistence
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ trading_db.py - SQLite database for trade tracking
â””â”€â”€ data_sync/ - Webull data synchronization
    â”œâ”€â”€ webull_sync.py - Main data sync orchestrator
    â”œâ”€â”€ position_sync.py - Current positions sync
    â””â”€â”€ trade_history_sync.py - Historical trade data sync
```

### Key Design Patterns

**MainSystem Class Workflow:**
1. `authenticate()` - Handles login with image verification retries
2. `discover_accounts()` - Finds all available trading accounts
3. `sync_webull_data()` - Syncs actual Webull data to local database
4. `log_system_status()` - Reports system health

**Authentication Flow:**
- Encrypted credentials stored in `data/` folder using Fernet encryption
- Session persistence to avoid repeated logins
- Browser DID support to reduce image verification requirements
- Automatic retry logic for image verification failures

**Account Management:**
- Multi-account support (Cash, Margin, IRA, Roth)
- Per-account configuration in `PersonalTradingConfig`
- Account-specific settings for day trading, options, position limits
- PDT (Pattern Day Trading) protection

**Data Architecture:**
- Local SQLite database (`data/trading_data.db`)
- Real-time sync with Webull APIs
- Comprehensive trade and position tracking
- Signal logging and strategy tracking

### Important Implementation Details

**Credential Security:**
- All sensitive data encrypted using `cryptography.fernet.Fernet`
- Credentials never logged or displayed
- DID (Device ID) stored separately for session management

**Error Handling:**
- Comprehensive logging to timestamped files in `logs/` directory
- Graceful handling of Webull API rate limits and image verification
- Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

**Configuration Management:**
- `PersonalTradingConfig` is the single source of truth for all settings
- Account-specific configurations with safety limits
- Trading permissions and risk management built-in

## Data Directories

- `data/` - Encrypted credentials, session data, database
- `logs/` - Timestamped log files with format `trading_system_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

## Wyckoff Trading Bot

### New Main Entry Points
- **Wyckoff Bot**: `python wyckoff_main.py` - Complete Wyckoff trading system
  - `--continuous` : Run continuous trading cycles  
  - `--single` : Run single cycle and exit
  - `--help` : Show usage information
  - (default) : Interactive mode with commands (cycle, status, performance, watchlist, config, export, quit)
